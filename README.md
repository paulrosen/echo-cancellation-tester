# echo-cancellation-tester

This creates a simple website that tests a browser's ability to turn echo cancellation off.

Echo Cancellation seems to be a somewhat volatile feature. Different browsers and different versions of browsers appear to handle
it differently. This website attempts to evaluate a particular system with a small amount of code.

All of the code that relates to recording is in `/src/audio/record.js`.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```
